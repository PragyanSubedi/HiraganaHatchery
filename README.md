This repo houses code to learn Japanese using Machine Learning.

(Disclaimer: I am a Nepalese-born individual with my first language as Nepalese and second language as English. This repository is my effort to simplify the Japanese learning process for others like me.)

## Hiragana Writing System

The writing system used in this repository for Japanese is "Hiragana".

"Hiragana (ひらがな) is a Japanese syllabary, part of the Japanese writing system. It is a phonetic lettering system. The word hiragana literally means "common" or "plain" kana (originally also "easy", as contrasted with kanji)." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana" target="__blank__"> Wikipedia </a>

To learn the Hiragana writing system, I've created the following notebook: <a href="hiragana_basics.ipynb" target="__blank__"> Hiragana Basics </a>
